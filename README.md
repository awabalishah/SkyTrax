   - `images/packages/package-5star.jpg`

3. **About Image** (Recommended)

**Quick Image Sources:**

### Change Colors

Edit CSS variables in `styles.css` (lines 2-15):

:root {
    --primary-color: #0066cc;        /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #00a86b;      /* Accent color */
    --accent-color: #ff6b35;         /* Highlight color */
}
```

### Configure Form Submission

In `script.js`, uncomment and configure the fetch API call (around line 75) to send form data to your backend:

```javascript
fetch('/api/contact', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
})
```

Or integrate with services like:
- Formspree
- EmailJS
- Netlify Forms
- Your own backend API
